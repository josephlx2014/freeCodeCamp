            <p>Albert Einstein was born in Germany in 1879, to a Jewish family. </p>
            <p>His father was an engineer and a salesman. Einstein wasn’t a very bright student. He even had problems with his speech.</p>
            <h1>Einstein’s Theory of Relativity</h1>
            Albert Einstein was working as a patent clerk in Germany in 1905 when he developed his famous Theory of Relativity (E=mc2). The theory simply states that the speed of light (constant, c) is the fastest speed in the universe and relates energy (E) and
            mass (M). It talks about how time and distance can change due to the different speeds of an object and its observer.
            <h2>Albert Einstein’s Discoveries</h2>
            <p>Photons : He discovered that light is made up of small particles called photons and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921.</p>
            <p>Bose-Einstein Condensate : Einstein discovered a state of matter with another scientist, Satyendra Bose. Today it is used in things like lasers.</p>
            <p>Atomic Bomb : Not directly connected with inventing it, but his Theory of Relativity is connected with the invention of the atomic bomb.</p>
